# Requirement Analysis in Software Development.

## Introduction

This repository contains resources, templates, and examples to help teams and learners perform clear and effective requirement analysis for software projects. Its purpose is to collect practical guides — such as SRS templates, stakeholder interview questions, use-case examples, and checklists — that make it easier to define what a system must do before development starts.

Intended audience: developers, product managers, students, and anyone involved in gathering or documenting software requirements.

Feel free to expand this README with a table of contents, contribution guidelines, or links to example documents and sample projects.

What is Requirement Analysis?

Requirement Analysis is a critical phase in the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) that involves identifying, gathering, and analyzing the needs or expectations of users, stakeholders, and the business. The main goal of this process is to ensure that the final software product aligns with the intended purpose and effectively solves the identified problem.

During requirement analysis, project teams work closely with clients, end users, and stakeholders to define the functional (what the system should do) and non-functional (how the system should perform) requirements. This phase often includes activities such as interviews, surveys, document reviews, and the creation of models or prototypes to validate understanding.

Importance of Requirement Analysis in SDLC

Clear Understanding of Project Goals
It provides a well-defined scope of what the software should achieve, helping developers and stakeholders maintain a shared vision throughout the project.

Prevents Scope Creep
By clearly documenting requirements early, teams can avoid unnecessary changes or additions later that could delay the project or increase costs.

Enhances Communication
Requirement analysis bridges the gap between technical and non-technical stakeholders, ensuring that everyone understands the objectives and constraints.

Improves Project Planning and Estimation
Well-defined requirements make it easier to estimate project timelines, budgets, and resources accurately.

Reduces Development Errors
Understanding requirements upfront helps developers design and code according to precise needs, minimizing costly rework during later stages.

Ensures User Satisfaction
When user needs are thoroughly analyzed and integrated into the system design, the resulting product is more likely to meet expectations and deliver value.
