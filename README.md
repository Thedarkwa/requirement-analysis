# Requirement Analysis in Software Development.

## Introduction

This repository contains resources, templates, and examples to help teams and learners perform clear and effective requirement analysis for software projects. Its purpose is to collect practical guides — such as SRS templates, stakeholder interview questions, use-case examples, and checklists — that make it easier to define what a system must do before development starts.

Intended audience: developers, product managers, students, and anyone involved in gathering or documenting software requirements.

Feel free to expand this README with a table of contents, contribution guidelines, or links to example documents and sample projects.
