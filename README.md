# Requirement Analysis in Software Development.

## Introduction

This repository contains resources, templates, and examples to help teams and learners perform clear and effective requirement analysis for software projects. Its purpose is to collect practical guides — such as SRS templates, stakeholder interview questions, use-case examples, and checklists — that make it easier to define what a system must do before development starts.

Intended audience: developers, product managers, students, and anyone involved in gathering or documenting software requirements.

Feel free to expand this README with a table of contents, contribution guidelines, or links to example documents and sample projects.

What is Requirement Analysis?

Requirement Analysis is a critical phase in the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) that involves identifying, gathering, and analyzing the needs or expectations of users, stakeholders, and the business. The main goal of this process is to ensure that the final software product aligns with the intended purpose and effectively solves the identified problem.

During requirement analysis, project teams work closely with clients, end users, and stakeholders to define the functional (what the system should do) and non-functional (how the system should perform) requirements. This phase often includes activities such as interviews, surveys, document reviews, and the creation of models or prototypes to validate understanding.

Importance of Requirement Analysis in SDLC

Clear Understanding of Project Goals
It provides a well-defined scope of what the software should achieve, helping developers and stakeholders maintain a shared vision throughout the project.

Prevents Scope Creep
By clearly documenting requirements early, teams can avoid unnecessary changes or additions later that could delay the project or increase costs.

Enhances Communication
Requirement analysis bridges the gap between technical and non-technical stakeholders, ensuring that everyone understands the objectives and constraints.

Improves Project Planning and Estimation
Well-defined requirements make it easier to estimate project timelines, budgets, and resources accurately.

Reduces Development Errors
Understanding requirements upfront helps developers design and code according to precise needs, minimizing costly rework during later stages.

Ensures User Satisfaction
When user needs are thoroughly analyzed and integrated into the system design, the resulting product is more likely to meet expectations and deliver value.

Why is Requirement Analysis Important?

Requirement Analysis is one of the most crucial stages in the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) because it determines the success or failure of the entire project. Without a clear understanding of what users and stakeholders truly need, even the most well-developed software can fail to meet its intended purpose. Below are three key reasons why requirement analysis is so important:

1. Ensures Clear Understanding of Project Objectives

Requirement analysis helps all stakeholders — developers, designers, project managers, and clients — develop a shared understanding of the project’s goals and scope. This clarity minimizes confusion and miscommunication throughout the development process, ensuring that everyone works toward the same objectives.

2. Reduces Risks and Costly Rework

Identifying and addressing requirements early in the SDLC helps detect potential issues before they escalate. When requirements are misunderstood or incomplete, significant rework might be needed later in development — increasing time, cost, and frustration. A thorough analysis phase minimizes these risks by ensuring that the system is built right the first time.

3. Improves Quality and User Satisfaction

A system that aligns with users’ actual needs and business goals is more likely to be accepted and valued. Requirement analysis ensures that the end product is functional, efficient, and user-friendly, resulting in higher satisfaction and better overall software quality.

Key Activities in Requirement Analysis

The process of Requirement Analysis involves several structured activities that ensure the accurate understanding, documentation, and validation of user and business needs. Each activity plays a critical role in shaping the final software product. The five key activities are outlined below:

1. Requirement Gathering

This is the initial step where all relevant information about the project is collected from stakeholders, clients, and end users. The goal is to understand what the system should do, the challenges users face, and the expected outcomes. Common techniques include interviews, questionnaires, workshops, and reviewing existing systems or documents.

2. Requirement Elicitation

Elicitation involves engaging stakeholders actively to draw out detailed, specific requirements. It goes beyond just collecting information — it focuses on uncovering hidden needs and clarifying ambiguous expectations. Methods such as brainstorming sessions, focus groups, and observation are often used to capture accurate and comprehensive requirements.

3. Requirement Documentation

After gathering and eliciting requirements, the information is organized and documented clearly in a structured format. This documentation may take the form of Software Requirement Specification (SRS) documents, use cases, or user stories. Proper documentation ensures that all stakeholders have a common reference point throughout the development lifecycle.

4. Requirement Analysis and Modeling

In this stage, the gathered requirements are analyzed to identify conflicts, dependencies, and feasibility. The analysis ensures that the requirements are clear, complete, and consistent. Modeling techniques such as data flow diagrams (DFDs), entity-relationship diagrams (ERDs), or UML diagrams are used to visually represent system behavior and relationships.

5. Requirement Validation

The final step is to verify that the documented requirements accurately reflect stakeholders’ needs and are feasible within technical and budgetary constraints. This step ensures that errors or misunderstandings are identified early. Validation techniques include reviews, walkthroughs, prototyping, and testing to confirm alignment with project goals.

Types of Requirements

In software development, requirements are broadly categorized into Functional Requirements and Non-functional Requirements. Both types are essential for defining what the system should do and how it should perform. Below is an explanation of each, with examples tailored to a Booking Management Project.

1. Functional Requirements

Definition:
Functional requirements describe the specific behaviors, features, or functions that a system must perform. They define what the system should do to meet user and business needs.

Examples for the Booking Management Project:

Users should be able to search for available rooms based on location, check-in and check-out dates.

The system should allow users to create and manage bookings (add, view, edit, and cancel reservations).

The system should process online payments securely using multiple payment methods (credit card, PayPal, etc.).

The system should send booking confirmation emails automatically after successful reservations.

Admins should be able to add, update, or remove property listings from the platform.

2. Non-functional Requirements

Definition:
Non-functional requirements specify how the system performs its functions rather than what it does. They define the quality attributes such as performance, security, usability, and reliability.

Examples for the Booking Management Project:

The system should load search results within 3 seconds under normal network conditions.

The platform should be available 99.9% of the time to ensure continuous booking access.

The application should encrypt all user data and payment information for security.

The user interface should be responsive and mobile-friendly across devices.

The system should handle up to 10,000 concurrent users without performance degradation.
